## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where a character 'listens' to a non-traditional archive—a forest, a city street, a patterned rug—and hears a specific, layered history.
- Create a dialogue between a pragmatic engineer of the future and a guardian of the palimpsest, arguing over whether to build a new city or preserve an ancient, whispering site.
- Imagine a chapter from the point of view of *El Libro de las Corrientes* itself. What does it feel as new 'text' is written upon it by the flow of time?
- Write a letter from a young Gabriel García Márquez to Don Eliseo, responding to his claim that the Boom writers were 'just listening to the palimpsest.'

### Technical Entry Points

- Design a speculative interface for 'reading' a temporal palimpsest—a device or software that visualizes the bleed-through of historical layers into the present.
- Propose a data structure or archival system inspired by the novel's themes: how would you store information so future layers don't erase, but converse with, past ones?
